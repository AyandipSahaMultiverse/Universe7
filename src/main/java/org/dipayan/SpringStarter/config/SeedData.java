<p><i>The Spring Framework features its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">model-view-controller</a> (MVC) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_framework">web application framework</a>, which was not originally planned. The Spring developers decided to write their own Web framework as a reaction to what they perceived as the poor design of the (then) popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Struts">Jakarta Struts</a> Web framework, as well as deficiencies in other available frameworks. In particular, they felt there was insufficient separation between the presentation and request handling layers, and between the request handling layer and the model.</i></p>
                
<p><i>Like Struts, Spring MVC is a request-based framework. The framework defines <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern">strategy</a> interfaces for all of the responsibilities that must be handled by a modern request-based framework. The goal of each interface is to be simple and clear so that it's easy for Spring MVC users to write their own implementations, if they so choose. MVC paves the way for cleaner front end code. All interfaces are tightly coupled to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Servlet">Servlet API</a>. This tight coupling to the Servlet API is seen by some as a failure on the part of the Spring developers to offer a high level of abstraction for Web-based applications. However, this coupling ensures that the features of the Servlet API remain available to developers while offering a high abstraction framework to ease working with it.</i></p>

<p><i>The <code>DispatcherServlet</code> class is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_controller">front controller</a> of the framework and is responsible for delegating control to the various interfaces during the execution phases of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP request</a>.</i></p>

<p><i>The most important interfaces defined by Spring MVC, and their responsibilities, are listed below:</i></p>

<i><ul>
    <li><code>Controller:</code> comes between Model and View to manage incoming requests and redirect to proper response. Controller will map the http request to corresponding methods. It acts as a gate that directs the incoming information. It switches between going into Model or View.</li>
    <li><code>HandlerAdapter:</code> responsible for execution of objects that handle incoming requests.</li>
    <li><code>HandlerInterceptor:</code> responsible for intercepting incoming requests. Comparable, but not equal to Servlet filters (use is optional and not controlled by DispatcherServlet).</li>
    <li><code>HandlerMapping:</code> responsible for selecting objects that handle incoming requests (handlers) based on any attribute or condition internal or external to those requests</li>
    <li><code>LocaleResolver:</code> responsible for resolving and optionally saving of the locale of an individual user.</li>
    <li><code>MultipartResolver:</code> facilitate working with file uploads by wrapping incoming requests.</li>
    <li><code>View:</code> responsible for returning a response to the client. The View should not contain any business logic and should only present the data encapsulated by the Model. Some requests may go straight to View without going to the Model part; others may go through all three.</li>
    <li><code>ViewResolver:</code> responsible for selecting a View based on a logical name for the View (use is not strictly required).</li>
    <li><code>Model:</code> responsible for encapsulating business data. The Model is exposed to the view by the controller. (use is not strictly required).</li>
</ul></i>

<p><i>Each strategy interface above has an important responsibility in the overall framework. The abstractions offered by these interfaces are powerful, so to allow for a set of variations in their implementations. Spring MVC ships with implementations of all these interfaces and offers a feature set on top of the Servlet API. However, developers and vendors are free to write other implementations. Spring MVC uses the Java <code><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html">java.util.Map</a></code> interface as a data-oriented abstraction for the <code>Model</code> where keys are expected to be <code><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html">String</a></code> values.</i></p>

<p><i>The ease of testing the implementations of these interfaces is one important advantage of the high level of abstraction offered by Spring MVC. DispatcherServlet is tightly coupled to the Spring inversion of control container for configuring the web layers of applications. However, web applications can use other parts of the Spring Framework, including the container, and choose not to use Spring MVC.</i></p>

<p><i>Git was created for use in the development of the Linux kernel by Linus Torvalds and others developing the kernel.</i></p>

<p><i>As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client-server systems, Git maintains a local copy of the entire repository, a.k.a. repo, with history and version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. A repo is stored on each computer in a standard directory with additional, hidden files to provide version control capabilities. Git provides features to synchronize changes between repos that share history; copied (cloned) from each other. For collaboration, Git supports synchronizing with repos on remote machines. Although all repos (with the same history) are peers, developers often use a central server to host a repo to hold an integrated copy.</i></p>

in the street theater until the 1930s. Puppets of the Bunraku theater and ukiyo-e prints are considered ancestors of characters of most 
Japanese animation. Finally, manga were a heavy inspiration for anime. Cartoonists Kitzawa Rakuten and Okamoto Ippei used film elements
